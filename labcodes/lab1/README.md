2. Process of debugging using QEMU and gdb
..* make debug -- run PHONY recipe in Makefile. Use x /2i 0xffff0 and x /10i 0xfe05b to print the assembly code.
..* /etc/gdb/gdbinit stores the global config of gdb, add config there to enforce showing the assembly code (by reverse compilation?). 
..* add Use b *0x7c00 to set up breakpoint at address 0x7c00, after that use ni to step-run the code. Check code generated by gdb and find it's similar with what's in boot/bootasm.S and obj/boot/bootblock.asm
..* 0xffff0(A20 is turned off) is where BIOS code starts; 0x7c00 is where the bootasm code starts. 

3. GDT is initialized at bootloader; IDT is in uCore.
